# Passport-UserApp

<https://github.com/userapp-io/passport-userapp>

Authentication to UserApp is handled from the front-end, while authorization to the back-end API is done by providing the 
session token with a cookie. The [UserApp Passport strategy](https://github.com/userapp-io/passport-userapp) is then validating 
the session token before authorizing the API calls.

## Getting Started

* Get your UserApp [App Id](https://help.userapp.io/customer/portal/articles/1322336-how-do-i-find-my-app-id-) and replace 
'YOUR-USERAPP-APP-ID' in `app.js`.

* Install all the dependencies:

  `$ npm install`

* If your front-end is web-based with static files (such as AngularJS), copy it to the `public` folder.

* Start the Node.js server

  `$ node app.js`

* Browse to `http://localhost:3000`

* Try to sign up and log in. Two "articles" should load from the back-end.
